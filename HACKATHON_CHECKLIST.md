## 🚀 Pre-Submission Checklist

### Testing
- [ ] Run `npm install` successfully

- [ ] Run `npm run dev` - both servers start
- [ ] Test vindictiveness slider (1-10)
- [ ] Generate at least 3 different plans
- [ ] Test chat sidebar functionality
- [ ] Try without Replicate key (fallback plans work)

### Documentation
- [ ] README has all setup instructions
- [ ] QUICKSTART is easy to follow
- [ ] DEPLOYMENT guide is complete
- [ ] .env.example has all variables
- [ ] Code is commented where necessary

### Presentation Prep
- [ ] Take screenshots of the UI
- [ ] Record a demo video (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Prepare pitch: "AI-powered petty revenge planner"
- [ ] Have example scenarios ready to demo
- [ ] Test on fresh install to verify setup works

## 🎤 Pitch Points

**The Hook:**
"Ever been so mildly annoyed at someone that you wanted to plot elaborate but ultimately harmless revenge? No? Well, we built an AI for it anyway."

**The Tech:**
- Replicate LLaMA 3 70B for creative text generation
- LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Next.js 15 with modern React
- CopilotKit for AI interactions
- Ready to deploy on Digital Ocean

**The Dumbness:**
- Takes cutting-edge AI and uses it for the most petty purpose imaginable
- Over-engineered solution to a non-existent problem
- Makes people laugh at their own pettiness
- Actually works really well (which makes it funnier)

**The Demo Flow:**
1. "Let me show you how vindictive I'm feeling today..." (move slider)
2. "My target is... my neighbor who parks too close"
3. "The situation: They took my parking spot"
4. *Click button*
5. Watch AI generate hilariously over-the-top plans
6. "And yes, it gets more absurd at level 10!"

```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:8123 | xargs kill -9
```

### "Invalid API key"
Check `agent/.env` - keys should start with:
