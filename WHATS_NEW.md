## 🤔 Questions?

**"Why did we switch from the vindictive AI?"**
> You mentioned not having an OpenAI key. This version uses ONLY Replicate, so you only need one free API key!

**"Can I still do the vindictive idea?"**
> Sure! But that would need OpenAI. This meme generator is simpler and funnier!

**"Will this win?"**
> It's got everything: uses required tech (Replicate + Digital Ocean), it's hilariously dumb (intentionally bad memes), it's well-built, and it's fun to demo. Perfect for DUMB HACKS!

**"What if I want to change something?"**
> Everything is well-documented and modular. Easy to customize!

---

**Now go make some hilariously bad memes!** 🤖🎨

*"I'm 99% sure this will be the best project!" - AI that is 0% correct*
